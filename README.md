- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Barry1138
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Development, Web Design, Graphic Design, Politics, Economics, History, Science, and Digital Arts and Media 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Linux, Python, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL, SQL, HTML, and CSS
- Also you can tell by my name that I'm a biological man and if you still need your stupid pronouns, that means you're a stupid leftist retard. There are only 2 genders and it is not natural to be gay, bi, or tranny. Sorry to tell you but no one is born that way. Do whatever you want as long as it doesn't infringe on the rights of others.
- Plus if you hate Capitalism so much, you don't have any understanding or knowledge of economics at all and you are an economic illiterate.
- PS I Despise War, Slavery, Totalitarianism, Authoritarianism, Socialism, Communism, Marxism, Maoism, Stalinism, Leninism, Fascism, Nazism, Progressivism, Social Democracy, Modern Liberalism, Feminism, Neoconservatism, Social Conservatism and Political Correctness. Also, there is no such thing as Democratic Socialism.
- I am a proud proponent of Libertarianism, Classical Liberalism, Fiscal Conservatism, Objectivism, and Minarchism. Anarcho-Capitalism is okay, but I do not consider myself to be an anarcho-capitalist. Also, even though I'm a Libertarian based on political ideology; I'm a Republican based on party affiliation.
- I am a proud defender of Rugged Individualism, Pure Laissez-Faire Capitalism, an Unregulated Free Market Economy, Strictly Limited Government, The Rule of Law, Peace, Liberty, and Freedom.
